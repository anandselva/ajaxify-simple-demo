ajaxify-simple-demo
===================

A simple demonstration how to use history.js along with ajax

This is just an example to help demonstrate how to ajaxify a website

Ideally this would be used in combination with a server side language to reduce the redundant html files at the root level

Just a reminder, when working with ajax locally, it is best to run your projects on a personal web server like MAMP or WAMP. This demo will fail in chrome without a server running. However, it should work in firefox without a server.

This demo was inspired by a question on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/a/17688108/1363726
